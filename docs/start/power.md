# Power supply

Users have two options to supply power to Phenox2, using battery or external supply cable.

# About battery
Phenox2 operates 5 minutes on the fly, and 20 minutes on the ground with attached battery (3S, 180mAh). External supply cable should be used instead of battery when users want to use Linux system of Phenox2 for a long time (e.g. installing package from the Internet, or building new software). Also, discarge cables(red and black cable) of the attached battery are removed by us. So when users get a spare battery and want to remove discharge cable. please be careful for not causing short circuit.  

Also, please don't use supply cable when users want to fly Phenox2.

# Changing battery
Before inserting the battery plug to the main board, fix the battery to the protector with rubber band as shown in Fig.1.

When removing battery, remove rubber band and protector first, and  put your hand as shown in Fig.3. The way shown Fig.4 is not good because bending power to the main board is too strong, which may cause serious breakdown of the mainboad.
