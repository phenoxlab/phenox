# Principal Axes

# Axes and rotations
The direction of 3 axes are defined as shown in Fig.1.
 - X axis is rightwards.
 - Y axis is forwards.
 - Z axis is upwards.

Also, Rotation around x axis is "degx", rotation around y axis is "degy" and rotation around z axis is "degz" as shown in Fig.1. Please remember the definition because those names are used in Phenox Library.

# Direction of rotation of propellers
Phenox2 has 4 propellers, and we call them  "front rotor", "back rotor", "left rotor" and "right rotor". Please remember the definition because those names are used in Phenox Library.  
"front rotor" and "back rotor" rotate clockwise, and "left rotor" and "right rotor" rotate counterclockwise. So please check direction of rotation when users change spare propellers.
